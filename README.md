Python Projects Using OOPs

This repository contains 7 intermediate-level Python projects built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) principles.
Each project applies real-world scenarios to strengthen the understanding of classes, objects, and modular code design.

üîπ Summary of OOPs Concepts Applied

Classes & Objects: Every project is structured around class-based designs for modularity and reusability

Encapsulation: Sensitive information (like account PINs, balances, and user profiles) is secured using private attributes and controlled access methods

Inheritance: Projects like the Ride Booking App showcase code reusability by extending parent classes into multiple ride types

Polymorphism: Common interfaces are overridden across derived classes to achieve flexibility (e.g., different fare calculations for Car, Bike, Auto)

Abstraction: Complex implementation details (like file handling and transaction management) are hidden behind clean, user-friendly methods

File Handling with OOP: JSON storage and logs are integrated with classes, demonstrating persistence in an object-oriented manner

Practical Real-World Design: Simulations like ATM, Library, and Employee systems map OOP principles to real applications

Together, these projects highlight how OOP principles form the backbone of scalable and maintainable software development.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Account Simulator

Description: A simple simulation of a bank account where users can check balance, deposit, and withdraw money securely with PIN validation.

Use Case: Demonstrates secure account handling and transaction management in Python.

Concepts used:

Classes and objects

Encapsulation (private attributes for PIN & balance)

Conditional statements & loops

User input handling

2Ô∏è‚É£ Library Management System

Description: Manages a collection of books by allowing users to add, view, and track available titles in a library.

Use Case: Demonstrates data storage and retrieval for resource management systems.

Concepts used:

Classes and objects

Dictionaries for structured data

JSON file handling for persistence

Iteration and input validation

3Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Management System

Description: Stores employee details (name, ID, salary) with the ability to search and display information.

Use Case: Represents how companies maintain employee records digitally.

Concepts used:

Classes and constructors

Data persistence using JSON

Search functionality by name

Displaying structured records

4Ô∏è‚É£ Ride Booking App

Description: A console-based ride booking system where users can choose Car, Bike, or Auto and calculate fares based on distance.

Use Case: Demonstrates polymorphism and real-world fare calculation logic.

Concepts used:

Inheritance and method overriding

Polymorphism (different rides with same interface)

Menu-driven user interaction

Arithmetic calculations

5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure User Profile App

Description: Allows creation and secure handling of user profiles with sensitive details stored safely.

Use Case: Demonstrates encapsulation and data security in Python applications.

Concepts used:

Classes and encapsulation (private attributes)

Getter and setter methods

File storage for saving user details

Input validation and restricted access

6Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Management System

Description: Tracks product details like name, price, and quantity while maintaining a record of total items.

Use Case: Simulates a small business/shop‚Äôs stock management system.

Concepts used:

Class attributes (tracking total items)

Instance attributes for each product

JSON file handling for saving inventory

Console-based interaction

7Ô∏è‚É£ Mini ATM Machine (Mega Project)

Description: A complete ATM simulation with options to check balance, deposit, withdraw, and view transaction history.

Use Case: Realistic representation of how banking ATMs function with transaction logging.

Concepts used:

Object-Oriented Programming (classes, encapsulation)

JSON storage for account and transactions

File handling for persistent logs

Menu-driven interaction with multiple options

Error handling for invalid inputs and insufficient balance
