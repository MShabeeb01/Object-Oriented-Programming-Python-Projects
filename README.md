#Python Projects Using OOPs  

This repository contains **7 intermediate-level Python projects** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)** principles.  
Each project applies real-world scenarios to strengthen the understanding of **Classes, Objects, and modular design**.  


#üîπ OOPs-Based Summary  

- **Classes & Objects** ‚Üí Every project is class-based for modularity and reusability  
- **Encapsulation** ‚Üí Sensitive info (e.g., account PINs, user profiles) protected via private attributes & getters/setters  
- **Inheritance** ‚Üí Ride Booking App extends parent classes into multiple ride types  
- **Polymorphism** ‚Üí Common interfaces overridden across derived classes (e.g., different fare calculations)  
- **Abstraction** ‚Üí File handling, logs, and transactions hidden behind simple methods  
- **File Handling with OOP** ‚Üí JSON integrated with classes for persistence  
- **Practical Applications** ‚Üí ATM, Library, Employee, Inventory, and Ride Booking simulate real-world systems  

These projects highlight how **OOP principles form the backbone of scalable and maintainable software development**.  



## üìÇ Projects  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Bank Account Simulator  
**Description**: Simulates a bank account with PIN validation for secure deposits, withdrawals, and balance checks.  

**Use Case**: Secure account handling & transaction management.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Classes & Objects  
- Encapsulation (private PIN & balance)  
- Conditionals & loops  
- User input handling  



### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Library Management System  
**Description**: Manages a collection of books, allowing add, view, and track operations.  

**Use Case**: Resource management in libraries.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Classes & Objects  
- Dictionaries for structured data  
- JSON file handling for persistence  
- Iteration & validation  



### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Management System  
**Description**: Stores employee details (Name, ID, Salary) with search and display functionality.  

**Use Case**: Employee record management in organizations.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Classes & Constructors  
- JSON-based data persistence  
- Search by name  
- Structured record display  



### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Ride Booking App  
**Description**: Console-based ride booking with Car, Bike, and Auto options; fare calculated based on distance.  

**Use Case**: Demonstrates **polymorphism** in real-world fare systems.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Inheritance & Method Overriding  
- Polymorphism (different rides, same interface)  
- Menu-driven interaction  
- Arithmetic fare calculation  



### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Secure User Profile App  
**Description**: Creates and manages user profiles securely with private details.  

**Use Case**: Demonstrates **encapsulation & data security**.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Classes & Encapsulation (private attributes)  
- Getter & Setter methods  
- File storage for profiles  
- Input validation & restricted access  



### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Inventory Management System  
**Description**: Tracks product details (Name, Price, Quantity) while maintaining overall stock count.  

**Use Case**: Shop/business stock management.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- Class attributes (total items)  
- Instance attributes for products  
- JSON for inventory storage  
- Console interaction  



### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Mini ATM Machine (Mega Project)  
**Description**: A complete ATM simulation with balance check, deposit, withdrawal, and transaction history.  

**Use Case**: Realistic ATM banking simulation with logging.  

**Concepts Used**:  
- OOPs (Encapsulation & Classes)  
- JSON storage for accounts & transactions  
- File handling for logs  
- Menu-driven user interaction  
- Error handling (invalid input, insufficient balance)  



## ‚úÖ Conclusion  
This collection showcases how **OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)** can be applied to **real-world inspired Python projects**.  
Each project is modular, extendable, and demonstrates the **practical power of OOP in software development**.
